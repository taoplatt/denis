  "title": "Mad Max: Fury Road",
  "frameworks": {
    "Save the Cat": {
      "Opening Image": "Max stands alone in the wasteland, haunted by the voices of those he failed to save. His existence is stripped down to survival, reflecting a world without mercy.",
      "Theme Stated": "“Hope is a mistake.” Max’s bleak philosophy defines the film’s central theme — the tension between survivalist cynicism and the radical act of hope in a broken world.",
      "Set-Up": "Max is captured by War Boys and brought to the Citadel, a grotesque autocracy built on exploitation. We are introduced to Immortan Joe’s cult-like control, and Furiosa’s role as an Imperator.",
      "Catalyst": "Furiosa diverges from her convoy route, smuggling the Five Wives — women intended to bear Joe’s heirs — in a daring bid for freedom.",
      "Debate": "Max escapes captivity and briefly takes control of the rig. He must decide whether to abandon Furiosa and the women or join them. His instinct is to walk away.",
      "Break into Two": "Max chooses to cooperate. Together, they journey across the hostile terrain, an uneasy alliance forged under pressure.",
      "B Story": "Furiosa’s bond with the Wives deepens, while Max begins to see in them — and her — a glimpse of humanity he thought he’d lost. Their evolving trust becomes the emotional heart of the film.",
      "Fun and Games": "The film’s signature set pieces: explosive desert chases, battle rigs, and sandstorms. The action is relentless, stylized, and inventive, testing their resourcefulness.",
      "Midpoint": "They reach the Green Place, only to find it desolate. Furiosa breaks down — her lifelong hope was a lie. The plan has failed.",
      "Bad Guys Close In": "With nowhere to go, Joe's forces close in. Tensions rise among the group, and Furiosa is gravely injured during the retreat.",
      "All Is Lost": "Furiosa lies dying. Max, finally moved by something more than instinct, offers his blood to save her — a symbolic gesture of renewal and connection.",
      "Dark Night of the Soul": "Max suggests an audacious reversal: return to the Citadel. This shift reflects a philosophical turn — from escape to reclamation.",
      "Break into Three": "The group turns back and stages a bold counterattack through narrow canyons, now fighting not to flee but to liberate.",
      "Finale": "They kill Joe and take the Citadel. Max helps lift Furiosa as the people cheer — she is the new symbol of leadership and change.",
      "Final Image": "Max, his purpose fulfilled, fades into the crowd. A mythic figure restored not by conquest, but by compassion and solidarity."
    },
    "Hero’s Journey": {
      "Ordinary World": "Max is a drifter tormented by his past, living without hope or connection in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.",
      "Call to Adventure": "He is swept into Furiosa’s defection from Immortan Joe, forced along by circumstance.",
      "Trials": "He survives brutal action sequences, earns the trust of Furiosa and the Wives, and begins to reconnect with his own humanity.",
      "Ordeal": "At the Green Place, all hope seems lost. Max confronts his fatalism and offers a new path forward — to return and fight for change.",
      "Return": "Having helped overthrow tyranny, Max departs quietly, no longer just a survivor but a man who chose to care."
    },
    "Story Circle": {
      "You": "Max is a haunted survivor, closed off from the world, surviving moment to moment.",
      "Need": "He needs to rediscover purpose and the capacity to trust and fight for others.",
      "Go": "He becomes entangled in Furiosa’s mission and the Wives’ escape.",
      "Find": "He bonds with them, offers his blood, and proposes a new course of action — one rooted in reclamation, not escape.",
      "Return": "He helps liberate the Citadel and walks away, changed — a loner no longer defined solely by loss."
