  "frameworks": {
    "Save the Cat": {
      "Opening Image": "Cobb washes up on a mysterious shore — a disoriented figure caught between dream and reality, which foreshadows the film’s central conflict.",
      "Theme Stated": "Early in the film, Cobb states: “An idea is like a virus...” This line encapsulates the core theme: the dangerous, unstoppable power of belief and memory.",
      "Set-Up": "We learn that Cobb is a master extractor — someone who steals ideas from dreams. He is also a fugitive, unable to return home due to unresolved guilt over his wife's death. His team and emotional wounds are introduced.",
      "Catalyst": "Saito offers Cobb a way back to his children — a clean slate — if he can do the impossible: plant an idea in someone’s mind (inception).",
      "Debate": "Cobb hesitates, knowing inception is risky and potentially harmful. He also fears his subconscious projections, especially of his late wife, Mal, might sabotage the mission.",
      "Break into Two": "Cobb assembles his dream team: Arthur, Ariadne, Eames, and Yusuf. They dive into the multilayered dream world with their target, Robert Fischer.",
      "B Story": "The emotional spine of the story is Cobb’s inner battle with Mal. Ariadne becomes his confidante and moral mirror, urging him to confront his buried guilt.",
      "Fun and Games": "The mechanics of shared dreaming unfold: dream training, paradoxical architecture, zero gravity, and imaginative action set pieces.",
      "Midpoint": "The team enters the dream-within-a-dream. Stakes escalate — if they die in the dream, they’ll be trapped in limbo due to heavy sedation.",
      "Bad Guys Close In": "Mal’s interference worsens. Cobb’s mental instability threatens the mission. The deeper they go, the more fragile the dream becomes.",
      "All Is Lost": "Cobb and Ariadne must descend into limbo. Saito is dying. The mission — and Cobb’s hope for redemption — is on the brink of collapse.",
      "Dark Night of the Soul": "Cobb confronts Mal and accepts the truth: he implanted the idea that led to her suicide. He must forgive himself and let her go.",
      "Break into Three": "Freed from guilt, Cobb helps Ariadne escape limbo and searches for Saito in the deepest dream layer.",
      "Finale": "The mission is a success. Saito honors his promise, and Cobb returns to the U.S. He reunites with his children, at peace for the first time.",
      "Final Image": "The spinning top — a symbol of ambiguity — continues to spin, leaving us unsure if Cobb is dreaming, but suggesting he no longer cares."
    },
    "Hero’s Journey": {
      "Ordinary World": "Cobb is a dream thief consumed by guilt and separated from his family, surviving on corporate espionage and regret.",
      "Call to Adventure": "Saito offers Cobb a way home — one last job that involves inception, something Cobb claims is impossible.",
      "Trials": "Cobb assembles a crew and navigates hostile dreamscapes. He must balance the logistical challenges with emotional landmines, especially Mal’s recurring sabotage.",
      "Ordeal": "In limbo, Cobb confronts Mal’s projection and the painful memory of her death. This is his emotional crucible — the moment he must truly change.",
      "Return": "Having let go of the past, Cobb awakens. The mission succeeds, and he’s reunited with his children, spiritually and physically transformed."
    },
    "Story Circle": {
      "You": "Cobb is a brilliant extractor defined by loss, guilt, and a desire to return to his children.",
      "Need": "He must forgive himself for Mal’s death and confront his own subconscious fears to find peace.",
      "Go": "He accepts Saito’s offer to perform inception, diving deep into layered dream worlds with a team of specialists.",
      "Search": "Each dream layer challenges Cobb’s control and forces him to face manifestations of his guilt, especially Mal.",
      "Find": "In limbo, he finally acknowledges his role in Mal’s death and that he must let her go to move forward.",
      "Take": "Letting go of Mal is emotionally excruciating and risky — it means releasing the very dream that’s kept him close to her.",
      "Return": "He completes the inception, wakes up on the plane, and returns to the U.S. to see his children.",
      "Change": "Cobb is no longer consumed by guilt or trapped in dreams. He chooses the present, whatever its reality."
